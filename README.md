# data_1_checks
This repository contains all folders and assignments for the Knowledge Checks in the CodeKY Data Analyst 1 Spring 2023 

Knowledge check 1 is simply a python file, so no requirements needed

kc_2 will be a python notebook and will have requirements to be installed. The easiest way to accomplish this would be to:
    1. Navigate to the kc_2 folder in your terminal or command prompt
    2. Create a virtual environment within the folder by using the command:
        python3 -m venv venv
    3. Activate the virtual environment by using the command:
        source venv/bin/activate
    4. Install the required packages by using the command: 
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    5. The interpreter used for this project is the anaconda (conda)        version, hence the large requirements file. If your current interpreter already has the latest matplotlib and pandas, then it should work just fine.
